# N-1-MULTIPLEXER
This repository contains the RTL and testbench code for an N:1 Multiplexer. The N:1 Multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects one of the N input signals and forwards the selected input to the output. The selection is based on the value of the selection lines. This particular implementation allows for flexible input widths and numbers of inputs using parameters.
